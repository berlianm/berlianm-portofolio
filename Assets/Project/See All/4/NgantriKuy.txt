NgantriKuy is an application that solves real-world problems. Medical registration queues can be solved with a parallel and distributed system, which uses multiple computers to improve service efficiency by sharing the workload. The system application can reduce patient waiting time and improve overall patient satisfaction. The system and network architecture of a parallel and distributed system with RPC client-server consists of several components that are interconnected and work together to achieve certain goals, namely clients, servers, networks, parallel programs, and data.  Thus, a parallel and distributed system with RPC client-server can be an appropriate solution to improve the efficiency of medical registration queue services, but it is necessary to evaluate and understand the advantages and disadvantages of this solution, and implement it with appropriate security aspects.
